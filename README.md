# Text Data Analysis and Topic Modeling

This project aims to perform topic modeling by analyzing the titles of scientific papers. It includes steps from preprocessing text data to visualizing the most common words and identifying topics using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method. This analysis is conducted using various Python libraries.

## Requirements

- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- wordcloud
- scikit-learn

## Dataset

In this project, a dataset containing titles of scientific papers is used. The dataset should be provided in a CSV file named "data.csv".

## Steps

1. **Data Loading and Inspection:** Firstly, the dataset is loaded and structurally analyzed.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Text data is cleaned and converted to lowercase.

3. **Visualization of Most Common Words:** A WordCloud is created on the text data to visualize the most common words.

4. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Text data is transformed into numerical vectors using the TF-IDF vectorization method.

5. **Topic Modeling (LDA):** Topics are identified from the text data using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method.

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset:** Provide a dataset containing titles of scientific papers in a CSV file named "data.csv".

2. **Run the Code:** Execute the "main.py" file to follow the steps sequentially.
